# Hack-a-thing-2-stone 

## What I Attempted to Build

I attempted to make a mobile to-do list app by following a few tutorials I found online. I ended up having to somewhat modify the tutorials I found, which led to my hack-a-thing being somewhat of a combination of the few that I found. I also had to find some resources to aid in the set up of my local environment as I have never used `expo` and have limited javascript experience.

The tutorials/resources I used are as follows:
* https://nodejs.org/en/
	* I had to download the lates version of Node in order to get started on the tutorials
  
* https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/#installation
	* When following the primary tutorial that I found, the set-up was not well outlined and did not work for me. As a result I had to do some digging and found documentation on expo installation and commands

* https://techunderthesun.in/making-a-simple-todo-mobile-app-react-native/
	* This is the primary tutorial I followed. There were some aspects that did not work (the code was buggy for my versions and dependencies were not specified)

* https://medium.com/fact-tutorials/create-an-advance-to-do-app-using-react-native-37aa4c47417a 
	* This tutorial is also a to-do list app, but has some extra features and shows some extra steps in set-up/install that were. beneficial.

## What I Learned
Previously, my only experience with JavaScript was hack-a-thing-1, and that was a limited introduction that gave me the general concepts. In following my main tutorial, I was able to learn JavaScript more in depth as I had to determine where the bugs in the reference code were in order to even get my attempts to compile. I have also never used React Native or Expo so there was a rather steep learning curve of learning how to use both of these. I also changed a few aspects of the app, which provided me with a better learning by helping me do unique modifications to the code. 

## How this Relates to my Team's Project/Inspires Me
This relates to my team's project because we are planning to develop a mobile app to help roommate living situations. Since I have never done any coding for mobile apps, or really had any idea on where to start coding a mobile app, I thought that developing a basic app for hack-a-thing would be a good start

## What Didn't Work
Initially, I struggled a lot to get Expo/React Native set up on my local and functioning enough to show the blank template because the tutorial I primarily followed didn't specify any dependencies or show what extra installs I needed to do to support imports needed for the project. 
I also had some issues with Expo due to the tutorial I was following, since some of the variables/import types were out of date. For example:
* fontColor vs color 
* Linear gradient
* react-native-paper
For each of the above (and some not mentioned), I had to try to find documentation on what the proper import types are and, in some cases, find how to install them. 

Overall,  the set-up and debugging of code made this project well over 10 hours of effort for me, but it was worth it because I feel more comfortable with React Native and expo, as well as gaining some more experience in JavaScript. I found React Native and Expo to be very useful and relatively straight-forward once I figured out the set up and basic functionality. If my team decides to move forward with a mobile app, I think I would like to use React Native and Expo for development as it is not platform specific and provides some very useful tools.
